Hi, I’m @Fathimash13

- I’m interested in all things AI, ML, and fashion. I'm passionate about exploring how technology can revolutionize the fashion industry.
- I’m currently learning Introduction to AI at Syracuse University, and I'm set to graduate in May 2025.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects in the fields of AI or fashion — I love working on innovative ideas!
- Fun fact: I’m a multitasker (no surprise there!) — a tech girl who loves to travel.
